Overview
========

go-flows is a flexible and powerful flowexporter. Goals include

* Flexible specification of key and extracted features using NTARC specification.
* Simple API for implementing features.
* Feature implementation reuse by implementing features calculated from other features.
* Flexible output format.
* Optimized for speed.

Since some of those goals contradict each other, the focus it is not possible to achive yaf-like
speeds or memory requirements. Flexibility comes first, and performance second.
